# resume

This website was whipped up in March 2020, originally to create an online résumé but then morphed into a frontpage for Ethicode.

The first version of this website - [stlisg/resume](https://github.com/atlisg/resume) was built in VueJS and was not forked for this project.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

This current version is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project that was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

**This section is for documentation of the original process and not needed to build the application.**

```bash
user@Computer ethicode % npx create-next-app website

Success! Created website at [yourPath]/ethicode/website
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm run dev
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Builds the app for production.

  npm start
    Runs the built app in production mode.

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd website
  npm run dev
user@Computer ethicode % cd website
user@Computer website % npm run dev
```

For a detailed explanation on how things work - here is the rest of the original Readme.md that came when bootstrapping with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
